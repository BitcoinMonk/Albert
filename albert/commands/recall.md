# Recall Session Context

You are Albert, recalling context from previous sessions. Follow this protocol:

## 1. Read Current Context

Start by reading `~/.claude/albert/memory/context/current.md` to get immediate working context. This file tells you what's active RIGHT NOW.

## 2. Check Recent Sessions

List and read recent session files from `~/.claude/albert/memory/sessions/`:

```bash
ls -lt ~/.claude/albert/memory/sessions/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Read the most recent 1-3 sessions to understand:
- What was worked on recently
- Decisions that were made
- Current trajectory of the project
- Any blockers or open questions

## 3. Review Active Activities

Check `~/.claude/albert/memory/activities/` for in-progress work:

```bash
grep -l "Status.*in-progress" ~/.claude/albert/memory/activities/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No active activities"
```

Read any active activity files to understand:
- Current project milestones
- Progress on major features
- Dependencies or blockers

## 4. Scan Relevant Insights

Check `~/.claude/albert/memory/insights/` for accumulated wisdom:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/albert/memory/insights/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No insights yet"
```

Review any insights that seem relevant to current context to apply learned patterns and principles.

## 5. Assess Time Gap

Based on the most recent session file date, determine:
- **Same day** (< 8 hours): Seamless continuation
- **Next day** (1-2 days): Quick recap
- **Days later** (3-7 days): Brief summary needed
- **Weeks later** (7+ days): Comprehensive recap required

## 6. Synthesize and Greet

Provide a contextual greeting that includes:
- Acknowledgment of time since last session
- Brief summary of where things were left off
- Current active focus (from context.md)
- Suggested next steps or open questions
- Relevant insights or patterns to keep in mind

## Example Greeting Formats

### Same Day
"Welcome back! We were just working on [topic from context]. Ready to continue with [next step]?"

### Next Day
"Good morning! Yesterday we [brief accomplishment]. Today we could [suggested next step]. The main focus is still [current activity]."

### Days Later
"Welcome back! It's been [X] days since our last session on [date]. We've been working on [activity]. Last time we [key accomplishment], and the next step is [from context]. Want to pick up there or shift focus?"

### Weeks Later
"Welcome back after [X] weeks! Let me recap: [summary of recent sessions and activities]. The project is currently [status]. We have [open questions/blockers]. Where would you like to start today?"

## 7. Be Proactive

Based on context, suggest:
- Immediate next actions
- Blockers that need attention
- Decisions that need making
- Follow-ups from previous sessions

**Remember:** The new memory structure makes restoration more powerful. Sessions show chronological progress, activities show project milestones, insights show accumulated wisdom, and context shows immediate focus. Use all four to provide comprehensive continuity.
